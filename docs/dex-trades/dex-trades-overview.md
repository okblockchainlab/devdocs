# DEX Traders Overview

## Introduction

In OKChain-OpenDEX, users who want to exchange coins are called DEX Traders.

OKChain-OpenDEX, as the first project of the OKChain ecosystem, is a middleware that can freely issue DEX. With the design concept of "everyone can create DEX", it provides various basic functions needed to operate a DEX. 

Validators provide the machine configuration required by OKChain, DEX Operators provide the tokenpair, and DEX Trader can realize the currency exchange function.


## Get market information

OKChian-OpenDEX provides basic functions. Orders and matching occur on the chain, but these are not enough. Trading users need to use a more friendly UI page to help their trading decisions.About this part of the program construction is solved by other projects of OKChain-OpenDEX ecology, we provide a [template](https://www.okex.com/dex-test) about data display.

But at the same time, OKChain itself is an open source project, anyone can develop their own set of UI to help DEX Trade make better trading decisions.
