Introduction
============

What is OKChain？
-----------------

OKChain is a set of open-source blockchain projects developed by OKEx,
aiming to promote the landing of large-scale commercial applications
based on blockchain technology. It gives each participating node the
same rights, allowing users to launch a variety of decentralized
applications smoothly, issue their digital assets, create their own
digital asset trading pairs, and trade freely. The cross-chain
technology is the key to achieving the landing. Through the cross-chain
module, the value interconnectivity, user interconnectivity, and
scenario application interconnectivity of blockchain can be realized
simply and efficiently, so that we can co-construct the ecosystem and
the value-added system.

What is OpenDEX？
-----------------

OKChain-OpenDEX, as the first project of the OKChain ecosystem, is a
middleware that can freely issue DEX. With the design concept of
"everyone can create DEX", it provides various basic functions needed to
operate a DEX. Compared with traditional DEX, it adopts full on-chain
matching and on-chain order book management to make matching information
more transparent and safe; compared with Ethereum-based projects, the
matching engine based on OKChain's call auction can achieve matching in
seconds, which is similar to the operating experience of a centralized
exchange. In addition, its unique design idea is not to build a DEX
belonging to a certain stakeholder, but to provide a platform to achieve
the separation of technology and operations. Just as Ethereum makes
digital asset issuance easy through smart contract technology, OKChain
lowers the barrier for operating digital asset trading pairs by OpenDEX.

The OKT
-------

Do you have OKT tokens? With OKT, you have the superpower to contribute
to the security and governance of the OKChain. Delegate your OKT to one
or more of the 100 validators on the OKChain blockchain to earn more OKT
through Proof-of-Stake. You can also vote with your OKT to influence the
future of the OKChain through on-chain governance proposals.

Learn more about `being a
delegator <../delegators/delegators-faq.html>`__.

OKChain Explorers
-----------------

These block explorers allow you to search, view and analyze OKChain
data—like blocks, transactions, validators, etc.

-  `OKlink <https://www.oklink.com>`__

OKChain CLI
-----------

``okchaincli`` is a command-line interface that lets you interact with
the OKChain. ``okchaincli`` is the only tool that supports 100% of the
OKChain features, including accounts, transfers, delegation, and
governance. Learn more about ``okchaincli`` with the `delegator's CLI
guide <../delegators/delegators-guide-cli.html>`__.

Running a full-node on the OKChain Testnet
------------------------------------------

In order to run a full-node for the OKChain mainnet, you must first
`install ``okchaind`` <../getting-start/install-okchain.html>`__. Then,
follow `the guide <../getting-start/install-okchain.html>`__.

If you are looking to run a validator node, follow the `validator setup
guide <../validators/validators-guide-cli.html>`__.
