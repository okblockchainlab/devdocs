![Welcome to the OKChain](../images/cosmos-hub-image.jpg)

# Introduction

The OKChain is the first of [thousands of interconnected blockchains](https://cosmos.network) that will eventually comprise the **OKChain Network**. The primary token of the OKChain is the **OKT**, but the Hub will support many tokens in the future.

## The OKT

Do you have OKT tokens? With OKT, you have the superpower to contribute to the security and governance of the OKChain. Delegate your OKT to one or more of the 100 validators on the OKChain blockchain to earn more OKT through Proof-of-Stake. You can also vote with your OKT to influence the future of the OKChain through on-chain governance proposals.

Learn more about [being a delegator](../delegators/delegator-faq.md), learn about [the security risks](../delegators/delegator-security.md), and start participating with one of the following wallets.

## OKChain Wallets
