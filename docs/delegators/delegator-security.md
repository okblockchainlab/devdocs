# Delegator Security

The launch of any public blockchain is an incredibly exciting time, and it's definitely one that malicious actors may try to take advantage of for their own personal gain. Owning and having access to cryptocurrency can make you a valuable target for an attacker, but there are many things you can do to improve your personal security and reduce or eliminate security risks.

## Social Engineering

_[Social engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security))_ has existed for about as long as human beings have been on the planet, and in the technical era, it usually takes in the form of  [phishing](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-avoid-phishing-attacks)  or  [spearphishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing#Spear_phishing) . Both of these attacks are wildly successful forms of trickery that are responsible for over 95% of account security breaches, and they don't just happen via email: these days, opportunistic and targeted phishing attempts take place  [anywhere that you have an inbox](https://www.umass.edu/it/security/phishing-fraudulent-emails-text-messages-phone-calls) . It doesn't matter if you're using Signal, Telegram, SMS, Twitter, or just checking your DMs on forums or social networks, attackers have a  [plethora of opportunities](https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/weaponization-social-media-spear-phishing-and-cyberattacks-democracy)  to gain foothold in your digital life in effort to separate you from valuable information and assets that you most definitely don't want to lose. If a deal pops up that  [sounds too good to be true](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-in-the-machine/201712/how-fear-is-being-used-manipulate-cryptocurrency-markets) , or a message shows up asking for information that should never, ever be shared with someone else, you can always verify it before engaging with it by navigating to our official website or an official OKChain communication channel on your own. 

* **Be skeptical of unexpected attachments, or emails that ask you to visit a suspicious or unfamiliar website in the context of blockchains or cryptocurrency.** An attacker may attempt to lure you to a  [compromised site](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2013/02/tools-of-the-trade-exploit-kits/)  designed to steal sensitive information from your computer. If you're a Gmail user, test your resilience against the latest email-based phishing tactics  [here](https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com/) . 

* **Do your due diligence before purchasing OKT. Neither the Tendermint team nor the Interchain Foundation will be selling OKT at launch**, so if you see social media posts or emails advertising a token sale from us, they're not real and should be dismissed immediately. If you're on the hunt for OKT, make sure that you've researched the seller or exchange to confirm that the tokens are coming from a trustworthy source. 

* **No one from OKChain, the Tendermint team or the Interchain Foundation will ever send an email that asks for you to share any kind of account credentials or your 12 words with us**, and we will always use our official Twitter, Medium, and Github accounts to communicate important news directly to the OKChain community.

If you receive an email or tweet that sounds too good to be true, is likely to be a scam.
