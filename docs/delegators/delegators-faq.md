# Delegator FAQ


## What is a delegators?

令牌持有者可以通过“委托”命令获得选票，选出自己认为对于生态有意义的validators，对于这些令牌持有者称之为delegator。

Delegators play a critical role in the system, as they are responsible for choosing validators. Being a delegator is not a passive role: Delegators should actively monitor the actions of their validators and participate in governance. 

## Motive for voting

投票是令牌持有者参与链上治理的最主要方式。谁将成为网络的validators。您希望validator的人员在技术上非常称职，因为如果链条上发生了什么事情-出现了一些错误，或者出现了新功能，validators将决定网络的运行方向，他们需要非常专业并且知道他们在做什么。

另一方面是社区生态方面。validators需要一起工作。如果有任何问题，则需要将他们放进一个房间。他们需要能够共同努力，成为社区的好领导人，并传播信息，保持高度透明。

您将选择将自己是否成为OKChain的Delegators。因此，请进行认真的投票，因为该链的未来取决于那些投票以及谁来管理它。

## Choosing a validator

In order to choose their validators, delegators have access to a range of information directly in [Lunie](https://lunie.io) or other OKChain block explorers.

- **Validator's moniker**: Name of the validator candidate.
- **Validator's description**: Description provided by the validator operator.
- **Validator's website**: Link to the validator's website.

## Directives of delegators

Being a delegator is not a passive task. Here are the main directives of a delegator:

- **Perform careful due diligence on validators before delegating.** If a validator misbehaves, part of their total stake, which includes the stake of their delegators, can be slashed. Delegators should therefore carefully select validators they think will behave correctly.
- **Actively monitor their validator after having delegated.** Delegators should ensure that the validators they delegate to behave correctly, meaning that they have good uptime, do not double sign or get compromised, and participate in governance. They should also monitor the commission rate that is applied. If a delegator is not satisfied with its validator, they can unbond or switch to another validator (Note: Delegators do not have to wait for the unbonding period to switch validators. Rebonding takes effect immediately).
- **Participate in governance.** Delegators can and are expected to actively participate in governance. A delegator's voting power is proportional to the size of their bonded stake. If a delegator does not vote, they will inherit the vote of their validator(s). If they do vote, they override the vote of their validator(s). Delegators therefore act as a counterbalance to their validators.
